## Abstract ðŸ“œ

### Background
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by substantial heterogeneity in both clinical phenotype and risk of adverse outcomes like heart failure and sudden cardiac death. This highlights a need for robust biomarkers for risk stratification. While previous studies have identified the role of select plasma proteins, comprehensive large-scale proteomic analyses have been limited in HCM.

### Methods
We analysed approximately 3000 plasma proteins in roughly 50,000 UK Biobank participants to identify proteins associated with HCM. External datasets including "All of Us" and the HCM Registry (HCMR) enabled external validation and cross-phenotype association with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-derived measures. Associations with adverse clinical outcomes were further identified, and causal relationships were evaluated using Mendelian randomisation. Relative biomarker importance was also assessed by joint modelling via machine learning.

### Results
We confirmed the associations of established biomarkers (e.g., NTproBNP, troponins I and T) with HCM status, incident diagnosis, imaging-derived endophenotypes of disease severity, and adverse outcomes. Mendelian randomisation analyses supported a causal effect of HCM on increasing NTproBNP and troponin T levels. Novel protein associations (e.g., **HRC, ACE2, ANGPT2, and LTBP2**) were identified, with **HRC** also showing prognostic utility for heart failure-related outcomes in HCM patients.

### Conclusions
This biobank-scale plasma proteomic study in HCM validates known biomarkers and identifies novel candidates (e.g., **HRC, ACE2**) with potential diagnostic and prognostic utility. These findings delineate the potential for plasma proteomics to enhance risk prediction and provide insight into HCM pathobiology, paving the way for future validation and mechanistic studies.
